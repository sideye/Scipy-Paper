Equity, Scalability, and Sustainability of Data Science Infrastructure
------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   We seek to understand the current state of equity, scalability, and sustainability of data science education infrastructure in both the U.S. and Canada. Our analysis of the technological, funding, and organizational structure of four types of institutions reveals major divergences in the ability of universities across the country to provide students with accessible data science education through Jupyterhub. We observe that generally liberal arts colleges and community colleges have much more difficulty setting up Jupyterhub, compared to well funded private institutions or large public universities with a deep technical bench of IT staff. However by leveraging existing public-private partnerships and mirroring aspects of Canada’s Syzygy model, the U.S. can provide greater access to a wider range of institutions and students to the Jupyterhub platforms.

Introduction
------------

Data science education has become incredibly in demand over the past decade, with increasing numbers of undergraduate programs and majors being developed. With this growth has come the rapid development of Jupyterhubs, which creates on demand, cloud based Jupyter notebooks for students and researchers. Jupyterhubs offer many benefits in addition to the flexibility and compatibility of the Jupyter environment, such as customization for different use cases, authentication, and campus-wide computing and storage. Overall, universities have found that using JupyterHubs can allow existing courses to scale while maintaining rigor and quality. But what has been the experience like for universities who have or are attempting to deploy Jupyterhub? This paper aims to document and understand the approaches and experiences of different universities who have successfully deployed Jupyterhub instances. 

Main Questions: 
Equity: Which institutions or departments have the ability to setup their own Jupyterhub? 
Scalability: How many universities, courses and students can each model of Jupyterhub support?
Sustainability: How expensive is it to deploy and maintain Jupyterhub infrastructure? 

To understand how Jupyterhub is affecting the equity, scalability, and sustainability of data science, we will investigate four cases studies of how JupyterHubs are being deployed in academic institutions across the United States and Canada that will highlight strengths and challenges of each model. These include: large, technical universities such as UC Berkeley, liberal arts colleges, wealthy private universities like Harvard, and the Canadian National Jupyterhub Model. 

We structure of our analysis first trying to understand educational goals of institution and how it drives funding' decision/structure. We then delve into the infrastructural costs, capabilities, along with team size. We last measure educational impact, such as the number of students served and the number of classes. 

Methodology -  We conducted over a dozen qualitative interviews with university faculty and IT staff from around the U.S. and Canada.  We also reviewed documentation found on Github. 
We conclude with a summary of the findings and potential ways to improve equity, scalability, and sustainability of the infrastructure. JupyterHubs provide a solution to these demands.
